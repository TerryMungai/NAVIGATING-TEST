		<p>Turns out, putting yourself down takes up a lot of brain space, and that limits
	    the room to actually act on your hopes and dreams. If you had told me eight months
		ago that this would be me, I wouldn't have believed you. Not only did I not think 
		that I deserve a good life ahead or accomplishments, but I also never believed I 
		could even talk infront of people and come out with something that would make sense.
		I was super reserved and lived in constant fear of judgment. No matter what I said or
		did, I was afraid it would be wrong, after a few months I started to practise on how 
		I should improve on my confidence through talking to people whom I never used to interact
		with and with time I gained confidence and found myself able to ask questions in class and
		answer some of the questions as well. When I thought I couldn't do certain things, I figured
		there was no reason to try. But when I put myself in the positive mindset of believing that I
		can, it's so much easier to throw caution to the wind and just go for it. I used to wonder, if
		I ask a question in class how would people take it forgeting that I had to do it for my own good.
		I now believe that if you want to do something you just have to believe in yourself and do it, because
		otherwise, it's not going to happen. People can't do that for you rather you have to do it for yourself
		and for your own good.</p>
