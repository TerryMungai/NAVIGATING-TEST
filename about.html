		<p>Turns out, putting yourself down takes up a lot of brain space,</p>
		<p>and that limits the room to actually act on your hopes and dreams.</p>
		<p>If you had told me eight months ago that this would be me, I wouldn't</p> 
		<p>have believed you. Not only did I not think that I deserve a good life</p>
		<p>ahead or accomplishments, but I also never believed I could even talk</p> 
		<p>infront of people and come out with something that would make sense.</p>
		<p>I was super reserved and lived in constant fear of judgment. No matter</p>
		<p>what I said or did, I was afraid it would be wrong, after a few months</p>
		<p> I started to practise on how I should improve on my confidence through</p>
		<p>talking to people whom I never used to interact with and with time I gained</p>
		<p>confidence and found myself able to ask questions in class and answer some of</p>
		<p> the questions as well. When I thought I couldn't do certain things, I figured</p>
		<p>there was no reason to try. But when I put myself in the positive mindset of</p>
		<p>believing that I can, it's so much easier to throw caution to the wind and just go</p>
		<p>for it. I used to wonder, if I ask a question in class how would people take it </p>
		<p>forgeting that I had to do it for my own good. I now believe that if you want to do</p>
	    <p>something you just have to believe in yourself and do it, because otherwise it's not</p>
		<p> going to happen. People can't do that for you rather you have to do it for yourself</p>
		<p>and for your own good.</p>
