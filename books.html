	<p> These are some of the things that seems to repeat themselves over and over</p>
	<p> around the world, we see from our book TREVOR NOAH the apartheid racism </p>
	<p>the word Afrikaans ment separateness. Under the apartheid, the rights </p>
    <p>associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other</p>
    <p> ethnic groups were curtailed. The white citizens lived in separate areas than</p>
    <p>black citizens, and reserved much less land for the black citizens to live,</p>
    <p>despite them making up large majority of the population. The black South Africans</p> 
    <p>lost their rights as South Africans and were forced to become permanent residents of</p>
    <p> the reserves. Another example is use of passes and coordination of documents,</p>
    <p>this act forced the black South Africans to carry their passbooks with them at</p>
    <p>all times. If someone was found without their passbooks, they could be arrested</p>
    <p>for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community.</p>
	
</div>
<div class="buk5">
	<p> We also see that the White got the good opportunity to have good jobs, live</p>
	<p> well and take their children to better schools than the Black,  in relation to</p>
	<p> this we see that in today life, those people who are rich have more connections</p>
	<p> than those people who are poor and are able to live a better life and generate</p>
	<p> more income than the poor. This is caused by discrimination since you can see</p>
	<p> that a poor person might  have a good certificate with high skills but still</p>
	<p> not able to get a job  and end up working to the rich families or get shallow</p>
	<p> jobs that don’t fit their skill. Another thing is during apartheid, Black women</p>
	<p> were Affected to an extreme discriminatory racial and gender  laws. They were not</p> 
	<p>	given many opportunities for women and were urged to respect their husband at all</p>
	<p> time, in this scenario we also see that in many countries women are not give equal</p>
	<p> opportunities like men, this is caused by a belief that women are surpassed to take</p>
	<p> care of their family  and  men take part as leaders of the family. Another thing we</p>
	<p> see that during apartheid is where children were divided into different classes</p>
	<p>	depending on their skin color. We can relate this scenario with the book Mans search</p> 
	<p>for meaning where we see that there is a lot of harassment in jail and we can relate</p> 
	<p>this picture to Trevor Noah book where women were harried and beaten by their husband</p>
	<p> without saying anything or even complain.</p>

	<h2>Structures we have inherited from colonial and western culture</h2>

	<p>	Colonialism, and missionary are platform upon which Western civilization and</p>
	<p> culture are thrive and sustained. While insisting that Western culture has</p> 
	<p> precariously contaminated the traditional values of Africa, Africa has established,</p>
	<p> well before the advent of colonialism, a pattern of home-grown political systems,</p> 
    <p> governance process and generally acceptable institutional rule-making arrangement,</p> 
	<p> such as progression in the pace of civilization of Africa and self-style tempo of</p> 
	<p> technological development. They have adopted the Western culture of leadership</p>
	<p> through democracy of which it has help in the promotion of social equality among</p>
	<p> people in a country in general. Though some of the things are not yet established</p> 
	<p> properly, it seems that the one adopted are working. In relation to technology, the</p>
	<p> adoption of western culture has really helped since now we have good communication</p>
	<p> and transportation. This has really helped in generating income easily without</p>
	<p> wasting of time since people used to use camel as means of transport. Also the</p> 
	<p> improvement of education is one of the great thing we accuired from Western culture</p>
	<p> since now people are more educated and number of illiterate people have reduced hence</p>
	<p> leading to good decision making in terms of thinking capacity and improvement in terms</p> 
	<p> of skills.</p>
	<p>The things that are supposed to be changed are Western culture of leadership, since most of the</p>
	<p> rules were changed by them from the time we adopted, and they have set up new advanced</p> 
	<p>	rules of which we are still left behind as salves of their mode of leadership. This is</p> 
	<p>	because we cannot compare the style of living between them since they are more advanced.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="buk12">
    <p>The Western culture has ruined the mode of dressing where people are now about to forget</p>
    <p>about their culture. People are walking half naked forgeting that, they are going to ruin the</p>
    <p> future generation and they will not be able to know anything about their culture. The only</p>
    <p>way that we are going to change this, is by ensuring that we educate the young people the</p>
    <p>importance of sticking to our culture in terms of dressing in order to have a better</p>
    <p> generation in future.</p>

		<h2>Ways in which youths can navigate their time during this period</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="buk15">
    <p>Many youths are home during this time, they can navigate this time by engaging themselves</p>
    <p> with different kinds of work such as analyzing what they can do best in terms of talent </p>
    <p>in order to avoid engaging themselves into bad behaviors. The most important</p>
    <p> thing is they have a good knowledge about technology and since we are now restricted</p>
    <p> to meet in groups, they can use this opportunity to form Whatsupp groups that can help and builed </p>
    <p>each other in terms of skills or come up with a project that can help them build their life </p>
    <p>instead of using social media in a wrong way.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>One of the  easiest thing especially for girls is knitting, they can form a group and make</p> 
    <p>different things like carpet using threads and earn a living and avoid challenges of borrowing</p>
    <p> money from men  of which at the end they end up being used and contract diseased or unwanted </p>
    <p>pregnancy. At this time is also a high opportunity that youths should take and plan their lives</p>
    <p> well by making use of the new technology since everything has been made easier and cheap by use</p>
    <p>of technology. They can take this time to attending personal studies online and improve in their skills</p>
    <p> It’s also a high time that youths should criticize bad behaviors</p>
    <p> in the community by taking care of each other as brothers and sisters, they should condemn those</p> 
    <p>who are taking advantage of young girls and report them. This will help in building a generation </p>
    <p>that is more concerned of each other in future, and be able to reduce bad behavior in the community.</p>
