	<p> This is part of the things that seems to repeat itself over and over</p>
	<p> around the world, we see from our book TREVOR NOAH the apartheid racism </p>
	<p>on Afrikaans word meaning separateness. Under the apartheid, the rights </p>
    <p>associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other</p>
    <p> ethnic groups were curtailed. The white citizens lived in separate areas than</p>
    <p>black citizens, and reserved much less land for the black citizens to live,</p>
    <p>despite them making up large majority of the population. The black South Africans</p> 
    <p>lost their rights as South Africans and were forced to become permanent residents of</p>
    <p> the reserves. Another example is use of passes and coordination of documents,</p>
    <p>this act forced the black South Africans to carry their passbooks with them at</p>
    <p>all times. If someone was found without their passbooks, they could be arrested</p>
    <p>for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community.</p>
